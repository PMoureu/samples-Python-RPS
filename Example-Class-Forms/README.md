# Class Forms for User Inputs

### Introduction
This file provides an example of class to automate the creation of basic windows forms. You can use it quite like a TaskDialog, plus you can ask user inputs.
It builds the form depending on the given parameters, and contains some features to check and convert them in the right format.
So you only have to define these parameters and display the box. The function will be called by the window itself, no need to catch the answer after.

### Setup 
You have to paste the file userform.py in a folder known by RevitPythonShell 
- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\RevitPythonShell2016  (in example)

And then import the class in your modules, as shown in the example you have two ways to declare an instance.

### Todo
- create more types, and more ways with different controls
- style, anchors, icons...
