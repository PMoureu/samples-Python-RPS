# Analysis Scripts 

## Layers

This script allows to export all Family Types containing a compound structure, 
and extract the details of each layers.

The values are sent to Excel via a csv file.

You may want to change the units base for the output, check the CONFIG PART to do it manualy, the UI part needs some improvements...
